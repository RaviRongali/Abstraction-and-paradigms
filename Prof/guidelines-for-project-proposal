               GUIDELINES FOR PROJECT PROPOSAL
-------------------------------------------------------------

Please submit  a short document  as a  project proposal in  the format
described below.  Submit it in the link provided in moodle.  Please do
it by 16th February, Thursday.

What constitutes a project?   Any coding problem that requires writing
about 300 lines  of Scheme code.  You may  code any application, game,
utilty  or whatever  pleases  you.   In the  end,  the project  should
demonstrate that you have learnt enough  from the course to be able to
write a  well written  program that employs  some of  the abstractions
discussed. However  the project  should also be  fun to code  - choose
something that you think will be interesting.

Now here are the guidelines regarding the proposal:

1. The proposal is expected to  be no longer than two pages.

2. It should have the following headings:
  a. Names of the students in the group doing the project. There will 
     be at most 3 students per group.
  b. Title of the project.
  c. A brief description of the problem.
  d. Some idea of the solution.
  d. Sample input output.
  e. Discussion.

3. The description  should be at the intuitive  level.  I shall prefer
examples and diagrams over long paragraphs of prose.

Remember the aim behind the proposal.
(i)  It is to bring some clarity to your own thinking.
(ii) To ensure that  the project is doable  i.e. 
     a. It is of the right  level of difficulty. It should not take so
     much of your time as to affect other courses.
     b. To  identify the resources (software packages  and tools) that
     you require and ensure that they are available under drracket.
