1. First install emacs and swi-prolog on your system

     > sudo apt-get install emacs
       ...
     > sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
       ...
2. You will find in your home directory, a file called .emacs (dot emacs).
Insert the following four lines in the file:

(autoload 'run-prolog "prolog" "Start a Prolog sub-process." t)
(autoload 'prolog-mode "prolog" "Major mode for editing Prolog programs." t)
(autoload 'mercury-mode "prolog" "Major mode for editing Mercury programs." t)
(setq prolog-system 'swi)
(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.pl$" . prolog-mode)
                                ("\\.m$" . mercury-mode))
                               auto-mode-alist))

3. This is how you run prolog programs:

a. First create  a prolog program.  Put the following  lines in a file
called test.pl Use any editor for  now, say gedit. Later you will both
develop programs and execute them in emacs.

%% The program starts here
woman(mia).
woman(jody).
woman(yolanda).

q(c).
q(d).
r(c).
r(d).
p(X) :- q(X),  r(X).
p(a).
p(b).
%% and ends here

b. at the command line say

> emacs test.pl &

The emacs screen will open up. 

c.  Now type

C-c return  --  that is  control-c  followed by  a
return.  At  this point  the  emacs  screen  will  be divided  in  two
halves. This is will be very similar to drracket.

d. Now at the prompt ?- on the lower screen, say:

?- [test].

This is similar to control-r in drracket. It will load the program for
execution. Now say:

?- p(X). return

It will print  X = c.  That is  one of the answers. Type  ; return and
will print the second answer X = d. The whole sequence will look like:

?- p(X). return
X = c ; return
X = d ; return
X = a ; return
X = b.

?-

Now cut and paste the following two lines in test.pl:

factorial(0,1):- !.
factorial(N,F):- N1 is N-1, factorial(N1,F1), F is N*F1.

And do a control-x control-s to save the file.

Once again, say

?- [test] to load the new program

?- factorial(5,X).
X = 120.

?- 

Well done, you have just run your first prolog program.
